Mountain grasslands in Europe have been shaped by a variety agricultural practices characteristic to the different groups that settled in the previously mostly forested mountain regions. Extensive, traditional agricultural practices formed over centuries landscape mosaics and introduced or facilitated the dispersal of many species. As a result, these ecosystems have become biodiversity hotspots, characterized by high levels of species richness. 

Since World War II, Switzerland and other central European mountain areas have undergone rapid development which has posed and still pose significant threats to grassland diversity, leading to the homogenization or loss of these valuable ecosystems. Intense agricultural practices became more and more the norm in easy-to-access areas, e.g. increased fertilized input and cut frequency, while the management of hard-to-manage areas (e.g. steep, remote grasslands) lost interest. As a result, traditional agricultural management practices have largely been substituted by modern agricultural practices or have been abandoned. Despite these challenges, European and Swiss agricultural subsidies have been introduced to preserve traditionally managed, species-rich grasslands, which have become essential for the conservation of biodiversity and cultural heritage.

My PhD aims to assess and quantify the changes occurring in European mountain grasslands. I will do this through case studies and then use modeling to apply these findings to broader mountain regions.
