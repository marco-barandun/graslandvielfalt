Grassland management practices are changing. Some grasslands are being abandoned, others are becoming more intensive, and some are shifting towards a more extensive management. Our research aims to explore these transformations across different biogeographic regions in Switzerland and assess their impact on biodiversity.

This MSc project focusses on the interaction between grassland management and grasshoppers communities. Grasshoppers are among the most charismatic and characteristic fauna of grasslands. They serve as valuable indicators of grassland management practices. This project aims to understand the variations in grasshopper communities across biogeographic regions in Switzerland. You will have the opportunity to travel to mountainous areas, where you'll visit various meadows with different managements and conduct surveys to assess the current grasshopper communities. Following fieldwork, we will provide additional data related to the vegetation of the study sites, along with supplementary grasshopper surveys.

Depending on the student's skills and interests, modelling approaches can be considered.
