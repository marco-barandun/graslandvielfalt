Grassland management practices are changing. Some grasslands are being abandoned, others are becoming more intensive, and some are shifting towards a more extensive
management. Our research aims to explore these transformations across different biogeographic regions in Switzerland and assess their impact on biodiversity.
This MSc project focusses on grassland vegetation composition. 

During the field season, you will have the opportunity to travel to mountainous areas, where you'll visit various meadows with different managements and conduct surveys to assess the current vegetation composition. Following fieldwork, we will provide additional data related to the study sites, along with supplementary vegetation surveys. 

Depending on the student's skills and interests, modelling approaches can be considered.
